# IBM_quantum_challenge_May2020
Hello there!
These four jupyter notebooks contain my solutions to the IBM quantum challenge held during May 2020 - my first experience with Quantum Computing on any platform. During this challenge, I was able to complete 3 of the 4 levels. Challenge 4 might be incomplete. Shall update the completed version soon. 

Thanks for visiting!
